# The OpenTechSchool Bookshelf

In this repository, we collect reading lists on the various OpenTechSchool topics. The lists will eventually be published on the OTS website. 

We'll also get in touch with the ZLB, the central library of Berlin, to make those books available to learners. 

Please add books and new lists by submitting pull requests. For discussing books and lists, feel free to use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/bookshelf/issues).
