by Dale Carnegie

The title might seems cheesy but that lies in the fact that this book has been published in 1936 the first time. In that book Carnegie shares his knowledge on business and work relations he and his team collected in during their entrepreneurship studies for almost 30 years. And though most of the topics seem obvious, Carnegie describes and explains them in a way that you notice you actually didn't know anything about it before. Greatest book about business relations ever.
